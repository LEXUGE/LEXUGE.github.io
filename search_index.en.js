have been reading the special relativity part of the Feynman's Lecture on Physics, despite not finding quite satisfied, which may happen to be caused by Mr. Feynman's mastery and intuition on Quantum Electrodynamics but not Theory of Relativity. So after days of trials, I ended up with a self-satisfied-primer-oriented explanation here.\n\nBackground and Albert Einstein's two famous postulates\nAs Feynman wrote in his lecture notes, Newton's classical mechanics is invariant under Galilean transformation, which Maxwell's profound equations failed to comply with. This was quite annoying at that time cause the , the speed of light, in the equation has got unspecified reference frame. And based on people's intuition at that time, they postulated that the  should be with respect to a media called ether, which is permeable in vacuum. A \"brilliant\" idea following that postulation is that one, by measuring the speed of light on earth, can tell the speed of earth with respect to ether. That idea was carried out in the Michelson–Morley experiment.\nHowever, the experiment failed, there is no interference occurred in the experiment. To explain that, Feynman said \"brilliant\" Hendrik Lorentz found doing some mathematical tricks (namely, Lorentz transformation) can solve this. However, that is quite physically counter-intuitive.\nIndeed, Einstein thought that the principle of relativity and light speed immutability (as shown by the experiment) should be both held. So, he had got two profound postulates which are our assumption for later discussions here. Two postulates are:\n\nAll physics laws hold in any inertial frame without difference. (Or, all inertial frames are equivalent). The inertial frame here refers to frames undergoing no acceleration.\nThe speed of light  is the same under any inertial reference frame.\n\nWith these two postulates, we are interested in how would transformation from one inertial frame  to another inertial frame  be like. And it turns out that transformation is the Lorentz transformation which we are about to derive later.\nMinkowski space-time diagram and the Lorentz transformation\nEinstein said graphs shall be easier to work with, therefore, we are here to use graphs. One graph, invented by Minkowski, is quite helpful to study the special theory of relativity. That graph incorporates both the time  and the position  to describe stuffs called events (explosion, meeting, clock-ticking, etc.) at a given position in space and a give time (that is where the word space-time comes from).\n\nAbove is a Minkowski diagram. line  is the time axis measured in meter (yes! we measure time in meter). Let us define the inertial reference frame  as the frame formed by  and . We also define the unit length of both time and position axis as the \"length on the axis\" used to express . This means the unit length is indeed equivalent to length for which  and .\nLine  is the locus of a moving particle (clock) with velocity   seen by observer in . (it's just like a  diagram!). Since the particle doesn't undertake any acceleration with respect to a non-accelerating inertial frame , with respect to that particle, we can also form an inertial frame called . Then, what we need to do is to find out what the  looks like and what are the unit length of . If we happen to know both, we can express any event (point) on the plane with respect to  using change of base in linear algebra!\nWe shall now see that for any inertial frame, the angles its time and position axes make with positive-sloped light pulse are the same. Firstly, draw a negative-sloped light pulse locus. Let  be the unit length on  and   be the unit length on . In order for it to have speed , we need to have . Let  and  . Likewise, we also have to have . It follows that both   and  .\nNow our task is to find what   is, or to find the unit length for  .\n\nFor this picture, we suppose there is a constant  such that\n\nwhere   is the unit vector of  . Similarly, we define\n\nOne important feature to note here is that since all laws are held in any inertial frame, with respect to , anything stationary in   is undergoing a constant motion with velocity  . That means applying same linear transformation to unit vectors   gives a linear transformation from B to A:\n\nLikewise, because of the reciprocity (or every inertial frame is equivalent) and  moves with  with respect to  , we have:\n\nWe also have\n\nThus,\n\nTherefore, we have\n\nThis also means the standard Lorentz transformation matrix is:\n\nOne may be misled to write following:\n\nthis supposes that  under basis  is the same as  under basis of  .\nHowever, it is not true. the above equation is equivalent as writing\n\nThe first matrix cannot be shown to be equivalent to matrix  , therefore, it fails the reciprocity and should never be right at the first place.\nRelativity of simultaneity, space-time interval, proper time, and proper distance\nWe all happen to know famous conclusions from Special Theory of Relativity (STR) like \"things are getting distorted\", \"we can make time pass slower\", etc.\nHowever, all of these are seen by one observer from one particular inertial frame. The real conclusion is that: being always in one particular inertial frame doesn't make you live longer (younger). Or more generally, comparing distance/time between two frames are quite meaningless actually, unless certain conditions fulfill.\n\nFor  , all the events on any slanted, positive-sloped line is simultaneous. However, one can easily see from the graph that this is not true for an observer in . Vice versa.\nFrom this point, we can see several conclusions arising.\n\nfor the same event, time for it to happen in  is longer than that in  . (time dilation).\nfor a event, the time measured in   of its simultaneous event in   is shorter than the time measured of itself in  . (this is quite alike number 4 and is indeed the reciprocal of number 1 as seen in  ).\nfor the 2 same events, length of it in  is longer than that in  . (Yes, I know this may seem to contradict length contraction, but it is true).\nmeasured at the same time in  , the length of 2 not necessarily same events is shorter than that in  . (length contraction).\n\nWe analyze these one by one.\nTo indeed get to understand these concepts (time dilation, length contraction, etc.), we have to define coordinate time, coordinate position, proper time, proper position. However, in order to define proper position/time, we have to have space-time interval first.\nThe space-time interval   is a quantity that is invariant under lorentz transformation.\n\nwhere   is the position vector.\nUnder two dimensional space-time (  and  ), we have equivalently:\n\nWe also define proper time as the time measured by a clock following its movement which may not be inertial (i.e. can undergo acceleration). And this quantity should be agreed under any inertial reference frame (i.e. invariant under lorentz transformation).\nWe now \"bind\" the clock to the moving particle. Luckily, we can have a local infinitesimal-short-lasting inertial frame in which the clock (and the particle) is at rest (i.e.  ), and by definition, in that local rest frame,  . Therefore, assuming   (later we shall see that this is called time-like events),\n\nThus, we can see\n\nLikewise, given    (later we shall see that this is called space-like events), we shall have proper distance differential  by\n\n(Here we cannot write it as an integral with respect to time because time may not be a parameter to this as the locus is always have slope smaller than 1).\nNow we define a few more terms.\nCoordinate time for event  under one inertial frame is simply the time component of that event under the frame.\nCoordinate position is likewise the position component under the frame for one particular event.\nFinally, we can analyze the conclusions.\n\nAs shown above, coordinate time is reason for time dilation (). However, the same event  measured at the same place under  is  (time \"contraction\").\nSame argument can be employed for the length. However, there is a very interesting phenomenon.\n\nIn the above picture, one in  can see both event (head and tail) at the same time. However, it is not the case for ones in . They can only see either head or tail.\nDo head and tail exist at the same time? It depends on your reference frame. And indeed, above example illustrates how absurd it is to compare phenomenons between frames together. One shall not do that unless things don't change, etc.\nIn addition to that, it is also pretty easy to see comparison between proper events makes sense if and only if both locuses start and end at the same event. It also follows that at least one of these two locus undergoes acceleration if the proper time differ. One shall be able to further prove that the one undergoing acceleration has less proper time.\nProof is like this. Take the inertial frame in which the inertial locus is in as our reference frame for the rest of the proof. Since another locus is accelerating, it has some velocity with respect to our frame. Therefore the integrand  for some time intervals, resulting in a smaller area under the curve and hence proper time.\nThe twin paradox\nThe following video explained it intuitively.\n\n    \n    \n\nOn the other hand, proper time is shorter for accelerated clock is also a direct argument for this paradox. Brother on the ship experienced less time, but he saw brother on earth experiencing longer time (see picture with \"inverse\" proper time function above). Those lines are continuously sweeping out the time axis of brother-on-earth frame.\nAnother thing to note is that it is mathematically impossible to have a sharp turnaround because in that way  is not differentiable, giving no velocity at the turning point. Even if it is possible, you will see your brother on earth age within just a snap.\nYou can be younger under acceleration.\nUnsolved bits\nThere are lots to learn in STR, namely, Relativistic dopler's effect, energy-mass equivalence, etc. I didn't cover these, but hopefully with basic tools here and infinite amount of mathematical talent, you can derive out all by yourself.\nI am wondering if there is a physical explanation that relates relativity of simultaneity and the fact that information travels at the speed of light.\nI didn't use a lot of mathematics here and drew a lot of graphs, because I came to understand: to learn physics well, you should see phenomenons without using heavy equations.\n","id":"https://lexuge.github.io/a-graph-based-note-on-part-of-the-special-theory-of-relativity/","title":"A graph-based note on part of the special theory of the relativity"},"https://lexuge.github.io/about/":{"body":"Hi there\nBIO\nI'm a senior high student who is interested in Rust Language and mathematics.

It has been 17 years since the terrifying war to SARS, but it seems little better. And most important, why?\n\nWhat's going on?\nIt is still unknown when did the virus comes out of the cage. Some rumor that the first group of patients was reported on December 8, 2019. Same from the source of the rumor, it is saying that doctors perceived these patients as the newly infected people of new SARS-like, unclear-sourced. However, it has not been seen by the public by that time until the drastic spread of the epidemic.\nOn December 30, 2019, one picture of internal announcement of arrangement and preparation on the ongoing virus from the claimed source of Wuhan CDC, has been leaked on the Chinese internet. And the CDC of Wuhan later had to admit that the announcement is true under the pressure of inquiries. According to Diyicaijing, on December 31, 2019, the market was still under normal operation, and nobody had heard the new virus. With the same reason of announcement, the suspected epicenter and origin of the virus, the Huanan Seafood Market, was closed.\nToday, I interviewed one person in Wuhan currently, inquiring about his perceptions and personal experiences during the whole period. He said he was shocked by the news headline of the new unclear-sourced virus as he came back to his home at Wuhan on December 30, 2019. People in his WeChat moment were retweeting constantly about the newly disclosed announcement issued by Wuhan CDC. But, in contrast to the heating responses online to the coronavirus, people seem not willing to take action in reality, not being aware of the necessity of covering their mouths with masks.\nAnd from his description, the city was running under the traditional model of the spring festival, without awareness of the surge of infections ahead anyway. And as we can see from the news, government and communities were continuing to organize different collective activities during the period of January 1, 2020, to January 20, 2020. These activities include gathering people for a feast (link dead) and holding party and show even if some of the crew members were showing symptoms of infection.\n\"The whole society went on as if there was nothing happened\", he said. While people who were not infected pretended to have nothing heard, the patients, on the other hand, were getting trouble in terms of either reality and virtual. Some of the Chinese Weibo users who were relatives to patients or patients themselves were tweeting that they were facing a shortage of detection and the fact that unable to be treated.\nOn the other hand, government and other CCP backed institutions were saying that the outbreak was under full control. But ironically, the one who said that was infected after soon. And the People's Daily had no coverage on the ongoing crisis in Wuhan, but full coverage of Mr. Xi's whatever.\n\"The situation held on until the report of the announcement of Zhong Nanshan, which has shaken the most of the people's confidence because of the confession of the presence of person-to-person transmission.\", he said, \"no sooner after the news from Zhong Nanshan, I have heard the news of Wuhan lockdown.\" On that day, he went back to Wuhan from other cities, but he perceived no special regulation or screening in the train station. People in the train station were not getting covered by masks. Luckily, the commodities in Wuhan are currently at the status of full supply according to him.\nAs the first case of infected patient emerged in Beijing, which is also the first case outside Wuhan, the central government and leader Xi Jinping, got to say the great incentives to beat down whatever epidemics. \"Confronted with the grave situation of this accelerating spread of pneumonia from infections with the novel coronavirus, we must step up the centralized and united leadership under the party central\" leadership, Mr. Xi said. However, he has never commented on the situation of the Wuhan outbreak after that.\nAfter Xi's significant comment, the whole country got into the status that is supposed to be in Wuhan 40 days before. But it's too late.\nComparing to the goofing off behavior of both central and local governments. Hong Kong government sensed the outbreak before it got truly started up. They set up the screenings in portals and airports. So did Taiwan and Macau. Soon after, Thailand did so. However, for Wuhan, it did not even about 20 days later, which is public outrage.\nDespite the big underlying issues, it is great to see that the government does take it faster than what they did 17 years ago.\nWhy?\nIt's very subjective and complicated to answer such a question. But for me, I think we are taking two faulty moves that eliminating either of which could help.\nLong-taken strategy of media censorship and surveillance\nIt is quite clear that China is taking pressing censorships on either social media and press. It is very important to have wide and great freedom for journalists and press to distribute copies of true stories without any manipulations. Though it is hard to ensure the absence of manipulations, different aspects of arguments and manipulations help us to figure out what the truth is. This is widely accepted by the international community but not by China.\nIn this case, even if we don't have a fast-mobilizing government behind, the outbreak scale could be reduced if the truth of the discovery of unclear-sourced virus is reported by journalists. By reporting and undercover, there would be no situation in which the whole society was marching towards the lake of epidemics because it was blind. People could be well-informed about the severity of the new disease, but not still be hanging out with no protections every day. Media plays a role in getting rid of ignorance for the citizens in the country. And if we have a bunch of blind, eye-covered or hand-cuffed media, it is clear as it is now of where our country would be led to. The answer is sentenced to death.\nOur strategy now, and same for almost every single big tragedy, is to whitewash, trying to gloss over scandals, outrages, faults. For why this is emerging, I don't want to talk about it cause it's out of our today's scope.\nFast-mobilizing and democratic government\nI know it's very annoying to be a leader of a democratic society or government cause you will face different arguments against you almost every moment. But what makes you upset helps society progress.\nHere I'm not talking about which system is the best to be a democratic one cause I don't think any of the current presented systems is great enough to be a pure democracy.\nSo why does democracy or being democratic help? Because the government or the executive branch will be sensitive about what is happening and not getting into the deadlock.\nAnd China gets both of two down. Few will deny that China's system is getting trapped by itself because every part is relatively blind. Furthermore, the system is quite unstable because what makes sense is the direction of the supreme leader. Today, he is Mr. Xi. The idea of the whole system gets almost unchanged as it was in Ming or Qing dynasties. One of the obvious drawbacks of this system is that it is quite insensitive. Big events need to undertake a long process to get informed or ready. And second is the deadlock. In Chinese society, people are refrained or afraid to raise your problem or protest cause we are under the great influence of one supreme leader. So under this scenario, people who can perceive have no guts to say. People who can say have no perceptions, or even not want anyone to stand out. Thus, the government falls in deadlock.\nBut it is also very hard to make it fast-mobilizing under democracy. Cause sometimes arguments itself can cause problems, such as bipartisan issues. Keep in mind to make the government a swift one is also important. One way of keeping this is by getting the executive branch its appropriate power. Put a \"supreme leader under control\".\nSo even if there is no freedom of media (most time not likely to be seen in a democratic society), the government can silently get all of the preventions enforced and information informed. But not in a way in which people are gathering together for the festival while the virus is going in surge underlying.\nEnd\nIf you are smart, then you may see that one autonomy which is undemocratic, is most likely not giving domestic medias freedom because disclosures always shake regimes. And if you have no freedom for journalists and media, there will also likely be no democracy because people are tamed to give up rights, any bits of them.\n","id":"https://lexuge.github.io/behind-the-2019-ncov-who-sentenced-country-to-death/","title":"Behind the 2019-nCoV, who sentenced country to death?"},"https://lexuge.github.io/beyond-boarder-a-trip-to-tokyo/":{"body":"\nAs the first time to go abroad, I go to the Tokyo which is one of the\nmega cities in Asia. I hereby write down what have been shown in\nJourney and something more.\n\nDay 1\nIt's August 18^th^ the first day of the journey. I was a kind of\nexcited in the morning before boarding because this journey would be my\nfirst trip abroad in combination of the first trip I would take alone.\nFirst touch\nAt 11:50 AM (UTC+8), I took off and I landed in NRT\nInternational Airport in Tokyo at 4:30 PM (UTC+9). At the process of\ncustom declaration, I found out that the fact that many elders were\nstill on their position of work, which reflected the ageing. I had no\nphoto here because of the prohibition of taking photo in Japan custom.\nThe subway system annoyed me a little bit for the first time. They have\ndifferent types of train like Local, Limited Express, Commuter Express\nand so on. The difference between these types is the number of stops.\nAnd since the subway system is privatized, many different companies had\ninvolved in it, giving you a confusing fact that why some lines cannot\ntransfer to another line.\nAfter taking a long way of subway from NRT to my residential, I ate the\nSukiya around it. Somehow, it was delicious anyway because I had took a\nlong ride of subway from NRT the place far away from the residential\nalthough it isn't in the downtown also. The place in which my\nresidential is gave me a sense of mixture of retro and progressive.\nBuilding's in the town are quite old since they are in the style of\n80s. However, in the relatively speaking downtown area in that town, the\narea around the subway station which is also very old-fashion like, they\nhave got all kind of stores that they need actually with the guaranteed\nservice because almost all of them are chain stores. Step into the old\nbuildings, you can find a sense of neat which is also scattered at\neverywhere in the city. That was my first sense to tokyo since I had not\ngot to the downtown actually.\nTokyo Ignitions\nIn the first night, I went to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building\nObservatory alone by riding the Shinjuku line to the Shinjuku station.\nStation of Shinjuku is quite big and you may lost in it since it have\ngot 6 floors and countless entries and exits.\nThe observatory is at floor 45 and free for everyone. Many foreigners in\nit since it is the almost best place to gaze afar in Tokyo. I came it in\nthe night, so I had got some night scenes:\n\n\n\n\n\n Not very sharp since I had\nnot got a tripod.\nAfter taking photo, I hung out in Shinjuku for about 1 hour and came\nback to residential at 10:40 PM.\n\n\nDay 2\n\nI have got the sense of living here.\nPeople not stirve to competition,\nBut setting higher standards,\nTaking the right order and proceeding on.\n-- Tokyo Metro staff, Making Tokyo Moving\n\nBeginning of the day\nI awoke at 6:30 PM. It was a great day of experience of local life in\nTokyo. With unamed flavor of fragmance scattered in air, I went to the\n7-Eleven store which laid one blocks away from my residential to buy my\nbreakfirst for today. I bought a sandwhich and a bottle of medium size\nmilk. Guess what? They have costed me JPY 500 with which I can have a\nlunch well done in UTokyo (I will mention it later).\nAfter a quick-charge, I got onto the road to start today's Journey\nwhich is taking Metro to the Tokyo National Museum and all the other\nmuseums around here, taking Metro again to the Ginza and visiting\nIntermediatheque, finally obtaining the ticket of Imperial Palace tour.\nEverything went on quickly and normally, I bought the one-day pass for\nboth TOEI and Tokyo Metro so I can easily do unlimited transfer and take\nthe metros in all the lines which are operated by these two companies.\nWith the instructions and tutorials from Google Maps, I sought the way\nout quickly and took turns in intricate ways. However and most\nimportantly, all the museums were closed today since it was Monday.\nWell, you can guess what I felt after walking about 3 km but found all\nof them were closed.\nThe university of Tokyo\nIn addition to the bad luck of having wrong\nday to visit the museums, It began to rain quickly. I had nothing to say\nbut thinking this morning had been spoiled. Shooting the dice, I went to\nthe University of Tokyo near here to see if anything can be found. Well,\nit is said that Authorized Staff or Invited Visitors only on the gate.\nHowever, after a while of hesitation, I stepped in this rust gate,\nthrowing all the cautions to the winds. As I walked on the lanes, no\nvisitors at all. All people in sight were undergraduate students,\ngraduate students in combination of professors and staff like janitors\nand deans. A kind of embarrassment, right? I shot as walk, here are some\npictures:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom my perception, UTokyo is a western university in eastern\nhemisphere. All the western like projects, associations, institutions\nand clubs can all be found in UTokyo which is a top university in both\nAsia and the world. In UTokyo, you can join the lectures which are held\nby other worldwide top universities such as UChicago, UCLA or UC\nBerkeley. As I saw, there was one poster right on the bulletin board and\nseveral pamphlets announced such a lecture.\nGreat university by great cafeteria!\nThe presence of great\ncafeterias inside the campus is one of the most crucial prerequisites\nfor becoming a great university (kidding). There was no exception for\nUTokyo either. I bought some exclusive stationary with slogan of UTokyo\non them in campus shop and got into the central cafeteria of UTokyo.\n\n\n\nDishes on the menus were very cheap, because of the absence of Rimen, I\nchose the medium size Miso Rimen (actually quite big) in combination of\nmashed potato salad. Two of them for JPY 490 only!\nUnusual experience of having lunch surrounded by a bunch of university\nstudents and professors. Like it!\n\n\n\nOne anecdote in cafeteria is that I went to the cashier 3 without\nnoticing the 'no cash' sign in front of it. However, when I was trying\nthe bill, the attendant asked me to swipe the card to pay. There was\nonly one idea stroke my mind: I have to use student card which I'm not\neligible to have to pay. After conversing with her, I realized my\nnegligence of 'no cash' sign and went to the cashier 1 instead.\nGinza\nFew of us will deny that Ginza district in a sense is the heart or the\nTokyo and a symbol of prosperity of Tokyo.\n\n\n\nTherefore, I went to the Ginza and hung out in a little part of it for\nan afternoon. I went to the Apple Ginza firstly. Without doubt, it is\nelegant in almost every aspects and I also found the Apple TV which was\nnot allowed to sell in mainland China.\n\n\n\nAnyway, I didn't buy anything in Apple Store because it is also\nexpansive in almost every aspects.\nI also visited the world biggest UNIQLO which has 11 floors and a lots\nof exclusive products.\n\n\n\nI got around all the floors but somehow bought nothing since I was not\ninterested in apparels at all.\nAnd finally, I went to the itoya which is a mega stationary store which\nhas compounded almost everything related to the stationary and even\nmore.\n\n\n\nI bought some pens and mechanical pencils. And that's all.\nAfter walking for whole afternoon, I went to a Starbucks near one\ncrossing and purchased a cup of TEAVANA. Another anecdote here: I asked\nfor lemonade flavor TEAVANA but the attendant just couldn't understand.\nSo I looked up the menu but found that although the items' name were\nannotated by English, the flavors weren't. So he listed all the flavors\none by one but somehow I just could not understand. In the end, I\nordered a Grande cup of black tea TEAVANA but it turned out to comprise\nof black tea, ice cubes but no sugar or syrup.\n\n\n\nDay 3\nMOMAT\nAs I mentioned yesterday, I would go to the museums as a compensation\nfor yesterday. The first museum that I chose as a destination is MOMAT\n(The national museum of modern art and craft), which later has been\nproved as a false move because I was just an idiot on the aspect of art,\nespecially the abstract branch. After several gazes of ignorance, I laid\non one chair in which I read the guide of tour. After finishing the\nreading of description of how to compliment and appreciate these\nabstract crafts varied in time and shape, I went to the next\ndestination, thinking my morning had been spoiled again by wrong choice\nof destination. Actually, I had quite big prospect of enjoyment with\nMOMAT since it has been mentioned in Lonely Planet magazine as the first\nvisiting spot for the Imperial Palace region.\n\n\n\nNational Archives of Japan\nAnyway, I carried on to visit my next\nplace in my list - intermediatheque by UTokyo. In the half-way, I saw\nthe National Archives of Japan and visited it. It preserved a lots of\nrescript of promulgations. In the museum, you can find the contracts and\nlaws which witnessed the developments of Japan's politics and the big\nevents in the history.\n\n\n\nIntermediatheque\nIt has exceeded my expectation definitely also.\nThe intermediatheque comprises all the most valuable collections in UMUT\n(the Universal Museum of the University of Tokyo), telling you the story\nof the history by showing you the true ones but not replicas. As the\ndirector of UMUT said, the dated matters in the history strokes should\nnever be forgotten. By visiting the museum, I came to a sense of\nstepping into the 19^th^ century. Taking photos was not allowed in\nmuseum in any forms, therefore, I have no photos but one of entry.\n\n\n\n* First Floor Inside the museum, on the first floor in\nintermediatheque (second floor in KITTE commercial complex), I saw a\nfull sight of different kind of fossils and specimens of various kind of\nspecies, including reptiles, amphibians, insects, vertebrates,\ninvertebrates, mammal and plants. They mainly came from the UMUT anatomy\nbranch. They were not only the fossils and specimens but also the\nnarrator of the history. Some of them were bought by professors of\nUTokyo for the purpose of researching while some of others were captured\nand framed by the students or professors themselves at Tokyo. You see\nnot only the specimens themselves, but also the strokes in history that\nthey have brushed. Then, I moved on to the next section in which I saw\nmany different kind of artifacts and the productions which marked the\nhighest standard and capability of the technologies in that time. For\nexample, you can see one elevator that Albert Einstein once used in\nTokyo university when he was visiting Japan to attend the conferences\nwhich were held in Tokyo university after he was awarded with the Nobel\nprize of Physics. On the rusty board of elevator, you can see through\nthe history.\n* Second Floor Then I went to the next floor in which many dated\nequipment and artifacts had been shown. In this section, you can see the\nhistory of UTokyo. My favorite collection is a set of sculptures for\nmathematics department. Of course not for depicting the professor. They\nwere used for researching and teaching in the field which concentrates\non the complex functions and surface because there was no computer\nsimulation or plotting in 19^th^ or early 20^th^ century and the\nsculptures of the complex surface were needed since functions are just\nintricate. They were beautiful and interpreted the mathematics in an\nelegant way. There were also other collections for dynamics and\nmechanics physics, I will just skip these.\nHHKB Yes!\nAfter the great experience in intermediatheque, I went to\nthe Bic Camera which is a big store compounds almost any electronics. I\nwas interested by neither computers nor cellphones but accessories like\n\nkeyboards!\n\n\nCowboys in the western United States leave their horses when they die.\nBut never leave their saddles, regardless of how long they need to\nwalk in the desert. Saddles are interfaces that are deeply adapted to\nour bodies whereas horses are consumable items. It should not be\nforgotten that computers are consumables nowadays, but keyboards are\ninterfaces that we can use through our lives.\n-- Eiiti Wada, Professor Emeritus at the University of Tokyo\n\nHHKB (Happy Hacking Keyboard) is a kind of specialty of Japan among the\nprogrammers, developers and IT practitioners. I'm not the exception\neither. So I bought one HHKB Professional JP (PD-KB420W) since it was\nCNY 700 cheaper than the price of Professional 2 in China and the JP\nversion is not provided in China.\n\n\n\n\n\nAsakura Temple\nIn the end, I went to the Asakura Temple which is a\nfamous spot in Japan but not only a temple. I got a fortune stick. Here\nwas what my stick said.\n\n\n\n\n\nDay 4\nOn day 4, I went to the Tokyo National Museum in which there\nwere a lot of national treasures and different types of collections\nwhich reflect the history of Japan. From these different culture\nheritages, I found out the Japanese culture was actually a combination\nof various Asian cultures such as Chinese culture, the Buddhism and the\nKorean culture. These culture composed the Japanese culture and exerted\ninfluence on it until meiji. The Chinese culture, of course, exerted its\ninfluence on Japanese culture mostly. From the collections which were\ncreated in Tang Dynasty, you can easily see the presences of Chinese\nfigures, characters and stories even verses.\nBuddhism had a very intriguing position in Japanese culture history of\ndevelopment. It was introduced to Japan at a very beginning time of\nJapanese history. The time of the Neolithic age even. Several kinds of\nsculpture of Buddhists were presented as the symbols of distributing of\nBuddhism in Neolithic age in Japan in the museum. Later it began to\nprosper again in Japan in the Edo period since the Buddhism became\nprestigious in Japan by the praising of the Tokugawa Shogunate.\nYou can also find many Chinese stories or characters in the museum as I\nmentioned above. They became a quite hot and predominant topics of both\npainting and writing in the period corresponding to the Tang Dynasty of\nChina. Also, the photo taking is prohibited in the museum, thus I have\nno photos. What a sad.\nIn the afternoon, one tragedy came. My Wi-Fi ran out of battery thus I\nhad disconnected from the whole world. It was a such a troublesomne\nproblem that I had to solve it as soon as possible. I went to the Family\nMart by finding the route on Google Maps by using the free Wi-Fi of the\nmuseum. Then I had no alternative but to bought a charging cable. It\ncosted JPY 1000! What a horrible and terrifying story. Anyway, I got the\nWi-Fi then.\nAfter I solved the problem, I carried on to the Shinjuku Express Bus\nTerminal to buy a round ticket for my Mountain Fuji trip.\nThat's the day.\nDay 5\nAs I mentioned yesterday, I would go to the mountain Fuji today. I slept\nfor a while after catching the highway bus. My bus took me to the 5^th^\nstation of mountain Fuji.\nI was supposed to stay and tour around the 5^th^ station as my previous\nplan. However, I decided temporarily that I would try to hike for a\nwhile to reach the 7^th^ station in order to enjoy myself to full. And,\nmore importantly, I had not got any professional equipment of hiking\nsuch as boots or alpenstock. Therefore, I was entitled with \"hiking\nwithout preparedness\" in a way by myself later on.\nThen, I went to hiking with a map, a bottle of water and a bag with a\ncamera and other stuffs inside.\nThis is an overview of the Fuijisan captured from 5^th^ station.\n\n\n\nThe trail between the 5^th^ adn 6^th^ station was quite easy to climb\nand \"flat\" in a way. And this is a pano took from the trail between\nthem.\n\n\n\nAs you can see from the picture, the altitude of that position at which\nI took the picture was actually the same as the clouds.\nThen I continued to hike on the trail, after the 6^th^ station, I found\nthe difference. The trail between the 6^th^ station and the 7^th^\nstation was somehow a kind of steep. Furthermore, the land under my\nboots comprised limestone and sandstone, which was very slippery and\ndangerous if you haven't got a pair of hiking boots. So my journey was\nactually very thrill.\n\n\n\nIn the end, I had done my hiking by climbing to the 7^th^ station.\nDay 6\nOn day 6, I got nothing to do but staying at my residential because I\nthought I had no regret about Tokyo and I was at a kind of tiredness.\nIn the evening, I checked in a hotel near the airport due to the early\nflight I would take.\nDay 7\nIt's the final day on which I stayed at Tokyo. Actually, I went to the\nNarita Airport by 5:40 and checked in later. The return journey was\nboring so I won't describe it in detail.\nConclusion\nI have got deep impressions about my journey of Tokyo.\nTokyo, as one of the most prosperous cities of Asia, is very flourishing\nwhile busying and steaming in order. Everything goes on in a fast pace\nbut orderly. The bus, metro, trains, crossing, they all runs on their\nown time.\nIn this typical Asian fast-pace metropolitan, I could easily feel the\ntenderness and the nervous scattered in the city air as it was breathed\nand inhaled again and again. This stifling atmosphere leads to the high\nsuicide ratio and many different mental illnesses.\nFurthermore, most Asians have introverted personality, Japan has got no\nexception. Also you may find that Japanese are welcome in some aspects,\nbut they are not the kind of people which are outgoing and that positive\nor sunshine. This is very different from the American style metropolitan\n-- New York City.\nTo sum up, Tokyo is an Asian style metropolitan which is composed of the\nAsian-like personalities and the modern ways of thinking and working,\nwhich were derived from western.\nThis is Japan.\n","id":"https://lexuge.github.io/beyond-boarder-a-trip-to-tokyo/","title":"Beyond Boarder - A trip to Tokyo"},"https://lexuge.github.io/hello-world/":{"body":"Welcome to Zola!\n\n","id":"https://lexuge.github.io/hello-world/","title":"Migration and whatnot in past 10 months"},"https://lexuge.github.io/more-rigorous-deduction-and-proof-on-youngs-double-slit-experiment/":{"body":"\nRecently, I have been studying physical optics. I found the formulas that are given in the textbook in the section of profound Young's double-slit experiment are quite \"approximate\". Since I always have the belief that Physics should be progressed in a mathematical manner with rigorous deductions and proofs, I decided to deduct some of the parts by myself and also try to prove the conclusions that are given in the textbook without proofs.\n\nWhat are we gonna to do?\nBefore our journey starts, we should first decide what to do. In this post, I will show you how to calculate the positions of any fringes on the viewing screen. Also I will show how the light intensity varies through different bright or black fringes on the screen (of course with proof!). And through the function that we acquired above, we will graph it.\nPrerequisite\nWe need to first define two sets\n\nObviously,  is the set of all the even numbers while  is the set of all the odd numbers. We also need to define some variables that have their own meanings.\n\nAbove is a image that illustrated the experiment.\nWe hereby define the  as the length between two slits and  as the length between the slits and viewing screen. Also, the  is for the wavelength of the light and  is the postion of the intersection of the two waves on the screen (with respect to the middle point of , upper side is for positive). The upper one is  and the down one is . Assume . Also we are not talking about  here, causing our approximation based on this assumption.\nGeneral function and qualitative analysis on it.\nFirst we need to investigate into the general function  that could describe the wave at any given time  with given  on the screen.\nFor a circular wave , the intensity . And since , . So from two above, we could see .\nHere, in order to make it simple, for the sake of the qualitative analysis, we set the coefficient to one. From the knowledge that we acquire, at any given point, the wave would be the algebraic sum of the waves. The two waves are, in this scenario:\n\nThus, the total wave  would be:\n\nHere goes the tricky part. Since  varies in , the amplitude of  would also vary in .\nWe here investigate the range of the amplitude of  because the light intensity would be proportional to the . Thus, if we could determine the condition of being black or bright, then we could work out the positions of fringes.\nIn order to get , there must be .\nAnd for the , two waves must be in phase.\nThus for the lowest amplitude,\n\nwhere  ( for upper black fringes).\nOn the other hand, for the highest amplitude, we must fulfill  where  ( for bright fringes in upper section or in perfect middle).\nAll in all, we could use \n\nwhere  to determine the relation between  and  when they form either bright or black fringes (depends on whether  or ).\nDeduction of  given the number of fringes.\nFrom first equation that we deduced above, we now use it to work out the  with given . First we could see that,\n\nSubstitute them into the equation,\n\nSince the  is too complicated, we need to do one approximation to that. Since ,\n\nSince  doesn't fulfill the original equation, the final solution to that would be: \n\nEquation above would be quite useful for you to determine the position of the fringes.\nLight intensity function\nBased on what we have discussed in first section, the function of light intensity  is\n\nwhere  is the coefficient of proportion. (Here we don't care about the relative order of  and  since they are ultimately squared).\nBased on the  that we acquired above, we could work out  and .\n\nThus, \n\nwhere .\nWe now graph separately the function when  and  (Following is not drawn to scale, only represents trend).\n\nOn the graph, the green graph is () and the purple one is () As you can see, as the  goes along the either side of  axis, the\nvalue of green one will go smaller.\nProof\nHere we will prove under approximation, the light intensity of bright fringes will go smaller and the intensity of black ones will stay . It's actually not precise but I can only find the proof to this extend. I have been finding the proof without compromising the beauty of mathematics for almost two days. But it turned out to be nothing based on my ability.\nSo how to prove?\nSince we are doing qualitative analysis, we may first simplify the third equation. It could be\n\nNow focus on\n\nWe have\n\nSimilarly,\n\nUnder this scenario, , thus it's obvious that the black fringes are  intensified.\nAnd for the bright fringes,\n\nFor , , while ,  and , , by which we can say that the light is at its peak when .\nConclusion\nI found out its just crazy to apply math to physics.

This post covers Electrostatics, Circuit, Magnetism and Electromagnetism in my own structure of understanding of all above. And since the post is guided by neither teachers nor guiders, content may not be correct.\n\nElectrostatics\nCharges and its related concepts.\nCharge is the bedrock of understanding all the concepts inelectrostatics and even further, because it relates to the electric field and electric potential.\nElectric Charge\nAccording to Wikipedia, electric charge is the physical property of matter that causes it to experience a force when placed in an electromagnetic field. The charge can be grouped by either positive or negative. More specifically:\n\npositive: rubbed glass rod.\nnegative: rubbed plastic ruler (amber).\n\nAnd the charges have the trait that unlike charges attract, like charges repel.\nThe unit of the amount of the charge is Coulomb, annotated as , where \nThe amount of charges of one proton is notated as , where .\nThe electric charge is quantized, meaning no fraction of  could be gained.\nLaw of Conservation of electric charge\nThis is another version of conservation of energy in the field of electrostatics. It states that:\n\nNo net electric charge can be created or destroyed.\n\nRemember the thing that it states is about is net charge. Thus it doesn't mean that there is no way to get something charged.\nWays to get something charged\nInduction\nInduction means to induce the charge while not truly give away the existing ones on one particular object.\nThere are two ways of doing so.\n\n\nInduction by separation\nOne positive charged object approaches another neutralized object. Since unlike charges attract, like charges repel, the near end of neutralized object would accumulate a group of negative charges, while the positive charges are repelled. If you now cut the original neutralized object in the middle, you can get one positive charged and one negative charged object out of it.\n\n\nInduction by grounding\nSame approach as above, instead of cutting it in the middle, we wire the far end of it to the ground.\n\n\nConduction\nOne charged conductor contacts another uncharged conductor. Note that conductor in the ideal way implies that electrons can move in it almost freely (Resistivity ).\nForce and field by charges\nCoulomb's law\n\nwhere . And  is the permittivity of free space.\nNOTE: For static situation only. The direction of  follows the rule of the attraction and repelement between charges.\nElectric field\nThis is a manmade concept which is deduced from the electric force.\n\n\nAs long as the  doesn't exert a large force on  that could move , we can calculate .\nElectric Field Lines (EFL)\nEFL has these three traits:\n\nEFL indicates the directions of the electric field.\nnumber of the EFLs passing through a given area which is normal to EFLs, is proportional to the magnitude of .\nThe number of lines pointing to the nodes is proportional to the magnitude of the electric charge of the node.\n\nElectric Field and Conductor (static)\n\n inside the conductor.\n\n\nRefer to the MIT Lecture Notes.\n\nExternal  is at normal at every point on the surface of the conductor.\n\nIf the tangential component of the external  is present at the point(s) of the surface. The charge(s) at these point(s) will flow along the surface in the direction of the  (opposite if  is negative), resulting in a dynamic situation rather than a static one. On the other hand, if only perpendicular component of  exists, the force made by  can be cancelled out by other forces (like normal force).\n\nAll the charges reside on the surface of the conductor under external . From the Gauss's Law, we can define a Gaussian surface rigorousl inside the conductor (not including surface). For that surface:\n\n\nsince the  is  inside conductor:\n\nTherefore,  equals to 0.\nGuass's Law\nDeduction\nFirst we define electric flux  as:\n\nAs second rule of EFL stated, .\nThus, . And since , . So for a enclosed surface in the space (we choose  as the constant of proportionality),\n\nIf we choose symmetric Gaussian surface, we could rewrite,\n\nsince  should remain constant in every angle.\nElectric Potential Energy and Potential\nSuppose there is situation that one charge is being moved from point  to  under uniform (Uniform electric field)\n\nwhere  points in the direction of decreasing .\nBy using Calculus, we can deduce the electric potential at point in the space due to point charge is: ( approaches 0 as r approaches infinity, plug sign in)\n\nCapacitance and Dielectrics\nCapacitance\nCapacitance is a device that can store electric charge, consists of two conductors (plates).\nThe charge required by each plate is:\n\nwhere  is the potential difference between plates. Here we will deduce the capacitance\n from the Gauss's Law.\nWe choose the surface around the positive charged plate as our Gaussian surface. The Right-hand-side of the Guass's Law, which is  would be  since the  is uniform. Also, we only have one side of the plates to emit the . Thus, after all, the  where the  is the area of one side of the plate. And furthermore, the  is perpendicular to the surface area, hence,\n\nWe also have,\n\nIn all,\n\nThe unit of capacitance  is . \nDielectrics\nAlso there is one kind of materials that has multiple enhancements for capacitance. It's called Dielectrics which is between the conductors (plates). \nTypically, it has three benefits for capacitance:\n\nTwo plates can be applied by high enough voltage without breaking down.\nConductors can be put close enough without touching each other.\nAmplify capacitance by constant , which means .\n\nEnergy stored in capacitance.\n\nElectric Circuit\nHere I omit some easy knowledge. So we first start with alternating\ncurrent.\nAlternating Current\nFor an alternating current system,\n\nTherefore,\n\n\nFrom the Calculus, we can know that . Thus,\n\nAlso, the rms (root-mean-square) of both  and  is very important.\n\n\n\nMagnetism\nBasics of magnetic poles\nLike the charges, there are also two types of poles (north and south). And they follow the rule of unlike poles attract, like poles repel. There is no single pole magnet until now.\nAmpere's law\nThe law states that\n\nwhich means \"Around a closed path, the sum of the component of the magnetic field tangent to the direction of the path equals  times the net current intercepted by the area within the path.\"\nMagnetic field, current, and force because of it\nLike electric field, magnets produce (induce) magnetic filed, which is denoted as . It is a vector and the unit of it is , tesla.\n\nIt has been found that the electric current can produce electric field around it. The magnitude of it is deduced as below.\n\nThe direction of the  follows the right hand rule 1 which is \"use your right hand to grasp the current in the way that thumb points in the direction of current, the direction of rest of four fingers would be the direction\".\nIt has also been found that for the current-carrying wire under , the wire will be subjected to the force exerted by magnetic\nfield.\n\nwhere  is a vector whose magnitude is the length of the wire in the field and whose direction is the direction of the wire.\nThe direction of the  follows the direction rule for the cross product of two vectors.\nThe previous expression could also be used to deduce the force on charges under field.\n\nIn particular, for a single charge (n=1), it can be written in the manner that .\nThe magnitude of  would be . And from here we can get the expression which defines the magnitude of .\n\nInduced emf\nMagnetic flux\nIt has been found that the emf could be induced by a changing magnetic field. For quantitative analysis, we define magnetic flux  similar to electric flux . (Direction of area could be chosen from either of the surfaces of the area . It doesn't matter as long as it is consistent.)\n\nFaraday's law\nAnd according to the Faraday's law, at any given time , the induced emf is equal to the instantaneous rate of change of magnetic flux through the area inside made by closed circuit. Here we express magnetic flux inside as a function of , .\n\nwhere  is the number of the turn of the circuit.\nHere I have to use the derivative form of the Faraday's law cause it's vital to express it as instantaneous rate of change.\nAC Generator\nAnd we can continue to do some work on the equation above if we are analyzing the AC generator. Since the  is\nchanging continuously, we can rewrite  in the form of a function. Suppose the area  that is formed by the circuit, orients the east direction at the beginning. And the  is uniform and parallel along the horizontal axis in the space. So at any given time , the angle that is made by the  and  is .\nThus:\n\nFor the sake of discussion, we set , so the Faraday's law under this scenario would be:\n\nOr, in terms of :\n\n\nAbove is the graph of . And we can spot out that the sign of  changes every , which means the direction of current in the circuit changes every half revolution. Also, we can see that the current is at its peak when\n\nAnd the conclusion above also holds for different situations in which circuit kicks off in different positions.\nThe direction of the current induced by changing magnetic field.\nNo Lenz's Law needed! It is possible to determine the direction of emf or current without using Lenz's law. The only thing you need is to use the so-called \"Left hand rule of Faraday's law\".\nPoint your left hand's thumb in the direction of .\nIf the sign of  is positive (WITHOUT MINUS SIGN AHEAD!), then the direction of your rest four fingers is the direction\nof the current.\nIf the sign of it is negative, then the direction of the current of the circuit would be in the opposite direction of your rest four fingers.\n","id":"https://lexuge.github.io/review-of-electrostatics-and-electromagnetism/","title":"Review of Electrostatics and Electromagnetism"}},"docInfo":{"https://lexuge.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://lexuge.github.io/a-graph-based-note-on-part-of-the-special-theory-of-relativity/":{"body":944,"title":7},"https://lexuge.github.io/about/":{"body":61,"title":0},"https://lexuge.github.io/abstract-algebra-learning-log-preliminaries/":{"body":352,"title":5},"https://lexuge.github.io/behind-the-2019-ncov-who-sentenced-country-to-death/":{"body":780,"title":6},"https://lexuge.github.io/beyond-boarder-a-trip-to-tokyo/":{"body":1561,"title":4},"https://lexuge.github.io/hello-world/":{"body":2,"title":5},"https://lexuge.github.io/more-rigorous-deduction-and-proof-on-youngs-double-slit-experiment/":{"body":373,"title":8},"https://lexuge.github.io/review-of-electrostatics-and-electromagnetism/":{"body":846,"title":3}},"length":9},"lang":"English"};
